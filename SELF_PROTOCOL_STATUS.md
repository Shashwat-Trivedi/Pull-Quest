## üîß Self Protocol Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Current Status
The Self Protocol SDK has been successfully integrated into PullQuest with the following features:

**Frontend Integration:**
- Official `@selfxyz/qrcode` and `@selfxyz/core` SDKs installed
- SelfApp configuration with proper disclosures
- QR code display with official SelfQRcodeWrapper component
- Mock verification fallback for development
- Deep link support for mobile users

**Backend Integration:**
- Official `@selfxyz/core` SDK installed
- SelfBackendVerifier configured with proper scope
- Verification endpoints ready for Self Protocol webhooks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Issues & Solutions

#### Issue 1: Public HTTPS Endpoint Required
**Problem:** Self Protocol requires a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint, but we're running on localhost.

**Solutions:**
1. **For Development Testing:** Use ngrok to tunnel localhost
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok
   npm install -g ngrok
   
   # Start your backend
   npm run dev # (on port 8012)
   
   # In another terminal, create public tunnel
   ngrok http 8012
   
   # Update .env.local with the ngrok URL
   VITE_SELF_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/self/verify
   ```

2. **For Production:** Deploy backend to a cloud service with HTTPS

#### Issue 2: Configuration Mismatches
**Problem:** Scope and configuration mismatches between frontend/backend.

**Current Fix:** 
- Simplified scope to `"pullquest"`
- Minimal disclosures for testing
- Proper error handling with mock fallback

#### Issue 3: Circuit/Network Compatibility
**Problem:** Self Protocol's staging network may have specific circuit requirements.

**Current Solution:** Mock verification mode for development testing.

### üß™ Mock Verification Mode

When Self Protocol's network is unavailable or misconfigured, the system automatically falls back to mock verification:

**Features:**
- Simulates the complete verification flow
- Creates mock DIDs and nullifiers
- Allows testing of the complete PullQuest bounty claiming flow
- Development-friendly with instant verification

**Visual Indicators:**
- Mock QR shows "Development Mode" indicator
- "Simulate Verification Success" button for easy testing
- Console logs clearly indicate mock mode

### üöÄ Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy Backend with HTTPS**
   - Use Vercel, Railway, or similar platform
   - Update endpoint in SelfApp configuration

2. **Register with Self Protocol**
   - Get proper app credentials
   - Configure production scopes
   - Test with real Self mobile app

3. **Enable Real Aadhaar Verification**
   - Wait for Self Protocol's Aadhaar support
   - Or use passport verification for international users

### üí° Current Testing Approach

**For Development:**
```bash
# 1. Start backend
cd PQBackend && npm run dev

# 2. Start frontend  
cd PullQuest-Frontend && npm run dev

# 3. Test verification flow
# - Connect wallet
# - Click "Verify with Aadhaar"
# - Use mock verification mode
# - Test bounty claiming with verified identity
```

**Mock Verification Flow:**
1. User sees mock QR code interface
2. Clicks "Simulate Verification Success"
3. System creates mock DID: `did:self:mock_[wallet]`
4. User can proceed to claim bounties
5. Sybil resistance still works via nullifiers

This approach allows complete testing of the PullQuest platform while we resolve the Self Protocol network configuration issues.
